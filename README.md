# Sentiment Analysis on IMDb Movie Reviews
This project is about text classification using an [IMDB daset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews) consisting of about 50K movie reviews.  
We'll fine-tune BERT(Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) to predict whether a review is positive or not, and then build a simple streamlit app out of it.
