# imdb_sentiment
This project is about sentiment analysis on a IMDB daset consisting of about 50K movie reviews.  
We'll fine-tune BERT(Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) to predict whether a review is positive or not, and then build a flask app out of it.
I'll keep documenting the project as I make substantial advancement :)
